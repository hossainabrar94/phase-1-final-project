# Crypto Lite™️ 

## Introduction
Crypto Lite™️ is a SPA that provides users with real time cryptocurrency data. This application integrates HTML, CSS and JavaScript to fetch and display data from the CoinCap API. The application allows users to view cryptocurrency prices, changes and few other details related to the crypto.

## Features 
- Real Time Crypto data
- Search functionality based on symbols
- Dynamic Content which updates the web page based on user interaction

## Project Requirement
1.  Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. Your API should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
3. Use at least 3 distinct event listeners to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. 
4. Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.
5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
